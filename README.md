(projects are ordered from easiest to hardest)

99 Bottles
-----------
- Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall."
- If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function.
- Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
- Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.
- Put a blank line between each verse of the song.

Magic 8 Ball
-------------
- I'm sure you've used a magic 8 ball at one point in your life. You ask it a question, turn it right side up and it gives an answer by way of a floating die with responses written on it.
- Allow the user to enter their question
- Display an in progress message( i.e. "thinking")
- Create 20 responses, and show a random response
- Allow the user to ask another question or quit

**Bonus:**
- Using whatever module you like, add a gui. Your gui must have:
- A box for users to enter the question
- At least 4 buttons: Ask , clear(the text box), play again and quit(this must close the window)

Pythagorean Triples Checker
---------------------------
- If you do not know how basic right triangles work, read this article on wikipedia[1] .
- Create a program that allows the user to input the sides of any triangle, and then return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.
- If your program requires users to input the sides in a specific order, change the coding so the user can type in the sides in any order. Remember, the hypotenuse (c) is always the longest side.
- Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.
