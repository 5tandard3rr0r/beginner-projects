Beginner Projects
-----------
(projects are ordered from easiest to hardest)

**99 Bottles**
- Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall."
- If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function.
- Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
- Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.
- Put a blank line between each verse of the song.

**Magic 8 Ball**
- Simulate a magic 8-ball.
- Allow the user to enter their question.
- Display an in progress message(i.e. "thinking").
- Create 20 responses, and show a random response.
- Allow the user to ask another question or quit.

**Bonus:**
- Add a gui.
- It must have box for users to enter the question.
- It must have at least 4 buttons: 
  - ask
  - clear (the text box)
  - play again
  - quit (this must close the window)

**Pythagorean Triples Checker**
- If you do not know how basic right triangles work, read this article on wikipedia[1] .
- Create a program that allows the user to input the sides of any triangle, and then return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.
- If your program requires users to input the sides in a specific order, change the coding so the user can type in the sides in any order. 
- Remember, the hypotenuse (c) is always the longest side.
- Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.
