### Caesar Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor
You probably already heard about the caesar chiper, right? If not, you can learn about it here: https://learncryptography.com/classical-encryption/caesar-cipher
The idea of this project is to do a caesar chiper encrypt/decrypt tool.

- Ask the user if he wants to encrypt or decrypt a message.
- If he wants to encrypt, ask for the key and print the encrypted message.
- If he wants to decrypt, ask for the and print the decrypted message. If the user doesn't have the key, print all possible solutions.
